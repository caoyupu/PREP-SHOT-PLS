# PREP-SHOT-PLS Model

The PLS model is a site-level capacity planning model for hydro-wind-solar systems developed based on [PREP-SHOT](https://github.com/PREP-NexT/PREP-SHOT). It enables capacity planning for wind and solar power stations at the site level, addressing the key questions of "where to build, what capacity to install, and with whom to connect" for these stations.
